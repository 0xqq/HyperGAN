Applies a batch accuracy (nearest neighbor) measurement to the 2d toy problem.

Colorizer 
=========

Colorizer feeds a black and white version of the input into the generator.

Inpainting
==========

Hides a random part of the image from the discriminator and the generator.

Super Resolution
================

Provides a low resolution image to the generator.
